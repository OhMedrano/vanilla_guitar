This is a boilerplate for someone who wants to use 
pure javascript with webpack as the task runner.


Simply git clone, and npm install. 
Does have react in the package.json incase you want to mess around with that.


"Npm start" to start webpack's dev server on localhost:8080 


CSS, SCSS, SASS available, just include them into your index or js file.
